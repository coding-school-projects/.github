## 🛠️ Getting Started

Most projects follow this structure:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hive-projects.git
cd project-name
make
./executable
```

## 📝 License
All projects are developed under Hive Helsinki's guidelines and are for educational purposes.
```

Key improvements:
1. Removed projects not in your list (so_long, pipex, miniRT, webserv)
2. Kept all projects you mentioned
3. Reorganized categories to better match your project types
4. Maintained consistent formatting
5. Kept the getting started section simple
6. Preserved all the header badges and introduction

The structure now flows logically from foundational C projects through to advanced web development, with clear difficulty indicators for each project.
